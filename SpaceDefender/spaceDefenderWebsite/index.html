	<h2>HOW TO PLAY</h2>
	<p>
		Space defender is a space game where you have to shoot enemy ships that spawn randomly with your ship.
		<br> You have HEALTH and POWER.
		<br> You loose X ammount of health depending on what sort of enemy you collide with or if an enemy bullet hits you.
		<br> Your POWER increaces constantly (with a 100 power limit when you start). You require POWER to shoot bullets from your ship. Different bullets require different ammounts of power. As you get to higher waves, you can store more power (300 MAX).
		<br>

		<br>
		<b>Controls:</b>
		<br>
		<b>Mouse Click</b> - Fire Small Bullet
		<br>
		<b>E</b> - Fire Big Bullet
		<br>
		<b>R</b> - Fire Biggest Bullet
		<br>
		<b>W</b> - While W Is Down, The Player Ship Will Not Move And You Can Shoot More Accurately If You Are Not Moving. (VERY Useful Button)
		<br>
		<b>NOTE</b> - Have Your Fingers On W, E, And R At All Times
